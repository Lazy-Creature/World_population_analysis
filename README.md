# World Population Analysis - Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict world population trends using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes historical population data and various features such as growth rate, population density, and percentage of world population share.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains the following features:
- **1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2015, 2020**: Historical population data.
- **Growth Rate**: Annual population growth rate.
- **Density**: Population density per square kilometer.
- **Population%**: Percentage of the world's population.

## 🧑‍💻 Machine Learning Approach
The following steps were taken in the analysis:
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Data normalization and scaling
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding trends in population growth
   - Visualizing correlations between features
3. **Model Training & Prediction**
   - Implemented regression models to predict future population
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE and R² score

## 📊 Results & Insights
- The model successfully captures past trends and provides insights into future population growth.
- Key factors influencing population changes were identified.
- Future projections can assist policymakers in planning for sustainable development.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
